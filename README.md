# AMN

In the first instance, amn is the helper wrapper I developed for myself to work with [express](https://expressjs.com/). As long as I go further, the functionality of amn grows and evolve. Onwards I equip all my back-ends with amn as it helps me to simplify the architecture, write less code, and boost my productivity.

> Why amn? I pick the name of the city from the great video game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.
