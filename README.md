---

In the first instance `amn` is the helper wrapper I developed for myself to work with expressjs. As long as I go futher the fuctionality of `amn` grows and evolve. 
Onwards I equip all my back-ends with amn as it really help me to simplify the architecture, wrigh less code, and boost my productivity.
`Amn` provides the following capabilities:
-	Helper middlewares to work with request, response.
-	Helper functions to work with request and client input.
-	Simplify and better orange your response code
-	Prettification capability to better control data you return to a client.
-	[under construction] Decorators
-	[under construction] Streamline error handling.
