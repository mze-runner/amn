# AMN

In the first instance, amn is the helper wrapper I developed for myself to work with [express](https://expressjs.com/). As long as I go further, the functionality of amn grows and evolve. Onwards I equip all my back-ends with amn as it helps me to simplify the architecture, write less code, and boost my productivity.

> Why amn? I pick the name of the city from the great video game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.

### General description

-	Helper middlewares to work with request, response.

AMN store is a simple key, value storage to help to move data through your middleware chain.

const myObjectToStore = { ... };

amn.store.push(req, { name : OBJECT_NAME, data: myObjectToStore});

const myObject = amn.store.pop(req, {{ name : OBJECT_NAME});
// return myObjectToStore

```

### Prettification

### Validation

### Error handler
